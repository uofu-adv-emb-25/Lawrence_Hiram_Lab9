// Invariants
1. Our FSM assumes ideal conditions, such as a ideal clock, contious power, sensors that will never wear down, etc.
2. For all tracks, only one train can be present. There will be a distance between trains, such that two or more trains will not be considered on the same track at a time.
3. Trains on each track only run in one direction.
